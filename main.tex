\noindent \normalsize \textbf{Microsoft Corporation - Software Engineer II} \footnotesize (Visual Studio Debugger) \hfill \small \textit{July 2020 - April 2024, Redmond, WA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed the full end-to-end experience for \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/using-breakpoints?view=vs-2022#BKMK_set_a_dependent_breakpoint}{Dependent Breakpoints} for Visual Studio 2022 which is used $\sim$100k times monthly and received \href{https://twitter.com/VS_Debugger/status/1437902110822047750}{great responses} and a CSAT score of 85
    \item Designed and built \href{https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/streamlining-your-debugging-process-with-breakpoint-groups/}{Breakpoint Groups} which required prioritizing and managing tasks, bugs, and testing for two other software engineers and resulted in delivering by expected date 
    \item Created Temporary Breakpoints which involved refactoring the debugger's glyph APIs and designing a better algorithm for persisting breakpoints using C\# and C++
    \item Proposed and completed implementation of telemetry and dashboards for dependent breakpoint groups, nested breakpoint groups, and certain advanced breakpoint types
    \item Wrote new API for gathering data from an exception's callstack for use with the debugger's AI (Copilot) exception helper
    \item Implemented \href{https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/whats-new-for-c-debugging-in-visual-studio-code/#data-breakpoints}{data breakpoint} support for the VS Code C++ extension for GDB scenarios \href{https://github.com/microsoft/MIEngine/pull/1257}{[link to PR]}
    \item Responsible for managing the VS Diagnostics ($\sim$50 people) main branch which involves forward/reverse integrations weekly, investigation and triage of issues
    \item Represented the debugger teams as the D\&I Champ to organize events and advocate for more inclusion within VS Diagnostics
    \item Created a method for determining if memory is owned purely by a debugger-generated TypeProxy managed object or by the debuggee process which saved the debugger from displaying an incorrect error message 100+ times per month
